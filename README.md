# Re: cursed
Simple turn-based RPG.

Description:

The dungeon descends in impossible patterns—floors repeating with tiny imperfections, as if the stone is trying to recall its own shape. You push downward, carrying a curse that grows heavier each time the halls fold back on themselves.

Creatures return in new forms. Rooms you’ve cleared feel familiar in the wrong ways. Loot appears where no one should have left it, hints of others caught in the same looping fall.

They say something waits at the deepest point—a final weight meant to break those who reach it. Defeat it, and the dungeon might let you go… or it might simply begin again, stacking your struggle atop all the others.

Down here, nothing ends cleanly.
The dungeon remembers.



# IMPORTANT

To play: compile all .java files in this folder (if not compiled yet) and then run main

no image buffer so manually edit BGs to be 1600x900 otherwise they wont fit in the window, worry implementing it later

we will not be using buttons, only panels with an image of what looks like a custom button

when implementing these panel buttons, as much as possible include print statements that confirm what was actually pressed
